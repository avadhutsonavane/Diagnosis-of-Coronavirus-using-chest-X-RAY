# COVID DETECTION

Healthcare is the most important topic in society .It tries to find the effective and robust detection as soon as possible to patient to get the appropriate care .It becomes very necessary in the medical field to detect the particular disease. The large no of techniques are used ,going beyond the traditional methods. The large number of techniques that are emerging makes it necessary to provide a comprehensive overview that avoids very particular aspects to find and make the detection

we are making the project dealing with the Machine Learning applied to the diagnosis of Covid diseases. This review focuses on modern techniques related to the development of Machine Learning applied to diagnosis of human diseases in the medical field, in order to discover interesting patterns, making non-trivial predictions and useful in decision-making.
In this we have used the more than 20000 X-Ray images  to train the model to get the best results of prediction. We have Images for Corona positive , Normal , Lungs Infection and viral Pneumonia . By using the Best Deep Learning model we have trained our model and we made the model for prediction .By using Transfer Learning we build our model. We have also added the self assessment Covid-19 form for the patient.
